Black Friday Examined
With the holiday season fast approaching, I found it intriguing to examine a dataset revolving around a hypothetical store and data of its shoppers. As described by the author, "The dataset is comprised of 550,000 observations about Black Friday shoppers in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values." (Mehdi Dagdoug)

Although this EDA + Apriori only utilized the provided dataset; similar techniques can be applied to any similar dataset or business problem.

Introduction
Origins:
The origins of "Black Friday" stem not from a day filled with shopping, discounts, and a turn of the holiday season, but rather with a financial crisis! The first recorded use of the term "Black Friday" was recorded on September 24th, 1869 when two Wall Street businessmen, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, decided to artifically inflate the price of gold and attempted to sell it for profit. As a result of their nefarious actions, on that specific Friday in September 1869, the price of Gold dropped and the United States plunged into a state of financial devestation.



First Recorded Use:
Various stories exist regarding the first recorded use of the term as it relates to holiday shopping, but its connotation continued to keep a negetive stigma associated with it until the late 20th century.

"Black Friday" and its relation to consumerism first derived from 1950s Philadelphia. Philadelphia suburbinites descended on the city after the Thanksgiving holiday, to watch the traditional Army/Navy college football game and take advantage of sales and promotions brought about by the influx of spectators to the city. Philidelphia Police Officers who were assigned to work that weekend coined the term due to their long grueling shifts and the mass amounts of people/shoppers. Philidelphia businesses also started to use the term to describe the long lines and shopping mayhem at their stores.

Use Within Business:
Although the term "Black Friday" originally represented the pitfalls of two Wall Street businessmen and the mayhem of downtown Philadephia following Thanksgiving, it is now familiarly known today as the busiest shopping day of the year.

One possible explanation/rumor for the term as it relates to consumers and retailers is that "Black Friday" represents the first day of the year in which businesses were turning profits and accounting was done on a hand-written ledger. As described Oxford Dictionary, "The use of colors in accounting refers back to the bookkeeping practice of recording the credit side of an account in a ledger in black ink and the debit side in red ink." (Oxford Dictionaries) Hence the name, "Black Friday" being associated with businesses debits overtaking their credits. Although this idea might make sense, the claim hasn't been completely verified.

In Recent Times:
"Black Friday as we know it today is an extravaganza of sales, promotions, and long lines outside of stores. Retailers such as Target, Best Buy, Amazon, and many others look forward to this day every year with the hopes that consumers will take advantage of door-busting deals. The term "Black Friday" has also spawned other retail holidays such as "Cyber Monday", "Small-Business Saturday", and "Giving Tuesday." Here are a few note-worthy statistics from 2018's "Black Friday."
